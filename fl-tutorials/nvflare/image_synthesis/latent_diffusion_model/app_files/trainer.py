"""NVFLARE Client API script for the FLIP latent diffusion tutorial.

Trains a ``DiffusionModelUNet`` inside a **frozen** autoencoder's latent space, on 3-D brain MRI, as
an ordinary single-stage FedAvg job: one ``train`` task and one ``validate`` task, dispatched on
``flare.is_train()`` / ``flare.is_evaluate()``.

**Conditioning.** A brain MRI study is four co-registered sequences (FLAIR, T1w, T1Gd, T2w), and the
model is told which one it is denoising: the modality is one-hot encoded and fed to the UNet as a
length-1 cross-attention sequence (``modality.py``). That is what makes one model able to generate a
T2w *or* a T1Gd volume on demand rather than an average of the four. Two knobs in ``config.json``
switch the whole thing, and they move together:

* ``MODALITIES`` — which sequences enter the cohort at all;
* ``net_config.diffusion_model.with_conditioning`` / ``cross_attention_dim`` — whether the model is
  told, and over how many classes.

Conditioned on all four is ``MODALITIES`` of length 4 with ``with_conditioning: true`` and
``cross_attention_dim: 4``. The unconditional single-sequence form is ``["T1w"]`` with
``with_conditioning: false`` and ``cross_attention_dim: 0``. Anything else is a mismatch, and the
parity test in fl-tutorials/tests/ refuses it — an unconditioned model quietly trained on four
mixed sequences is a plausible-looking way to get blur.

The autoencoder is not trained here. It arrives as an uploaded checkpoint declared by
``SERVER_CHECKPOINT`` in ``config.json``, which the FL server loads into the round-0 global model and
broadcasts — so this script never reads the checkpoint file, it simply receives autoencoder weights
along with the diffusion model's at round 0. Thereafter ``AGGREGATE_ONLY_REGEX`` keeps only
``diffusion_model.*`` on the wire, and the client rebuilds the full model from its cached round-0
broadcast.

Because the autoencoder is fixed for the whole run, this script freezes it explicitly
(``requires_grad_(False)`` + ``eval()``). Leaving it out of the optimizer alone would still
accumulate unused gradients on its parameters every step, and would run it in ``train()`` mode during
training but ``eval()`` during validation. Freezing is numerically neutral here (``AutoencoderKL``
uses GroupNorm and no dropout).
