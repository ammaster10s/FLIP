"""Guard the three image-synthesis tutorials' config wiring, which otherwise fails silently.

The ``autoencoder`` / ``diffusion_model`` / ``latent_diffusion_model`` tutorials are three
independent single-stage jobs, and the latent one consumes the autoencoder one's output as a frozen
encoder declared via ``SERVER_CHECKPOINT``. That handoff spans two directories and rests entirely on
convention, so every way it breaks breaks **quietly**:

* ``InitialCheckpointPTModelPersistor`` loads the checkpoint with ``strict=False``. A wrong submodule
  name or a wrong autoencoder architecture therefore matches *nothing*, raises *nothing*, and leaves
  the diffusion model training against a randomly-initialised encoder while it reports entirely
  plausible losses. This is the failure mode the tests here exist for. The architecture is not
  duplicated between the two ``config.json`` files: it is recorded once, in the
  ``autoencoder_config.yaml`` that ``extract_autoencoder.py`` writes beside a checkpoint and
  ``latent_diffusion_model``'s ``models.py`` reads. So the checks below compare that YAML against the
  `autoencoder` tutorial's *actual* construction rather than comparing two JSON literals — which also
  covers the arguments no shape comparison can see, ``norm_num_groups`` chief among them.
* ``SERVER_CHECKPOINT`` naming a file that ``job.py`` does not stage means the persistor looks for a
  file nobody produced — logged, not raised.
* ``AGGREGATE_ONLY_REGEX`` is a *privacy* control as well as a bandwidth one. ``PercentilePrivacy``
  takes its percentile over every variable concatenated together, so if the frozen autoencoder's
  exact-zero diffs stay in the update they drag the cutoff to ``0.0`` and the DP sparsification
  silently degrades to the ``gamma`` clip alone. An over-broad regex re-opens that hole.
* ``configure_config`` in the FL API *raises* when a config has exactly one local-rounds key not
  named exactly ``LOCAL_ROUNDS`` — but only at submit time, i.e. after upload, on the platform.
  Catching it here keeps that a local failure.

The three do not share a cohort: ``autoencoder`` and ``latent_diffusion_model``
train on 3-D brain MRI (four MR sequences per study), while ``diffusion_model`` stays on 2-D chest
X-rays as the cheap read-this-first tutorial. That adds a second silent-failure surface, because the
brain pair's conditioning is spread across two config keys that must agree:

* ``MODALITIES`` decides which sequences enter the cohort; ``cross_attention_dim`` decides how many
  classes the UNet's cross-attention is built for. A model told "4 classes" while the loader feeds 5
  raises; told "4" while the loader feeds 1 trains happily on three dead one-hot columns. And
  ``with_conditioning: false`` beside four modalities trains an unconditional model on four mixed
  sequences, whose failure mode is a blurred average that looks like slow convergence.

These are static checks over the shipped ``config.json`` / ``job.py`` files, plus one that
instantiates the latent network to compare the regex against real parameter names. Nothing trains.
